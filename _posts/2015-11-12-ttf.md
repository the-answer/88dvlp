title: Topical Trust Flow - TTF

During the REU, I helped build a computer simulation of the DLS to
quantify possible sources of systematic error. The simulation
realistically models the density of stars and galaxies in the
universe with realistic energy distributions. It allows the galaxies
to be distorted by an input dark matter distribution and it
realistically simulates the atmospheric point spread function and
atmospheric noise.


It separately simulates the 8 CCD chips that
make up the detector and it simulates the astronomical process of
dithering where multiple exposures at slight offsets are coadded
together. For increased efficiency, I wrote the simulation so that
it could be run in parallel on the computer cluster at Davis. Using
the simulated data, I measured the dark matter signal in the simulated
data and compared it to the signal in the Monte Carlo distribution.
